# ðŸ“š Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) â€“ Mini Projects in C++

This repository contains two C++ mini-projects designed to demonstrate the practical implementation of key Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts:

- A **comprehensive DSA system** featuring arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and BSTs  
- A simple yet complete **Student Management System**

Developed as part of coursework in the BS Artificial Intelligence program at UMT Lahore.

## ðŸ§  Projects Overview

### ðŸ”¹ 1. All-in-One DSA Concepts Project

This interactive, menu-driven project implements core data structures using class-based design and encapsulation. It allows users to perform all major operations like insert, delete, search, sort, update, and traverse.

#### âœ… Structures Covered:
- Arrays
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack (array-based)
- Queue (circular)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)

#### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- Object-Oriented modular classes
- Clean CLI-based menu navigation
- Full operation sets on each structure

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Student Management System

A lightweight, beginner-friendly C++ project that manages student records using basic array handling and class structures.

#### âœ… Functionalities:
- Add new students
- Update student details by ID
- Display all student records
- CLI-driven user experience

#### ðŸ§¾ Structure Used:
- Fixed-size array for storage  
- Class-based structure for student data  
- Input validation and buffer handling
